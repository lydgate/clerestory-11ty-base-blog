If you’re in London this weekend, I’ll be hosting my second in-person session on the philosophy I’ve been working on over the past few years. I’d love to see you there.

## Details

If the weather is good, as it should be, we’ll meet at **3pm, Sunday 25th June** , in the **Northeast corner of Lincoln’s Inn Fields** ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/41yuC5Z9iMP9NwAN7)). If it rains, we’ll go to the nearby pub **Cittie of York** ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/ULx2drGEqwyMuudY6)).

No background is necessary, but I would love you to listen to some of the podcasts I’ve done:

  * [Language and Experience](https://pod.fo/e/16f7ac)

  * [Crises and Revolutions](https://pod.fo/e/171350)

  * [Mental Proliferation](https://pod.fo/e/181509)




The last salon focused on the theory and philosophy behind my approach, whereas this session will focus on how to apply it practically.

If you are a member of the Interintellect, you can [RSVP here](https://interintellect.com/salon/london-irl-bryan-kam-on-neither-nor-second-session/). If you’re not a member, you’re still welcome to come. Feel free to bring anyone who might be interested.
