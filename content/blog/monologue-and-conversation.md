## A monologue

I’m excited to have recorded and released **[a podcast episode, in which I reflect on the universal and particular](https://anchor.fm/bkam/episodes/Wings-of-DesireLove-Constant-Beyond-Death-e1khrdt)** , using Wim Wenders’ 1987 film _Wings of Desire_ as a centrepiece.

The podcast, **[Clerestory](https://anchor.fm/bkam/)** , is available on all podcast apps, and I will be releasing more soon.

## Conversations

I’m also excited to be hosting live conversations on Twitter Spaces.

You can listen one to the very first one I recorded, on [personal knowledge management, with Achim Rothe](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1ZkKzbLnMmoKv?s=20). We spoke again last week about [linking knowledge with keywords](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YpKkZNReQmxj?s=20). I greatly enjoyed these conversations, and there will be more to come, so stay tuned.

## History, Research

Tomorrow, 2 July at 8pm UK time, I will be speaking to Sam Biagetti of the excellent [Historiansplaining podcast](https://historiansplaining.com), about how he researches and covers such vast and diverse periods of history. See [this tweet](https://twitter.com/bryankam/status/1538986596896210945) for details, should you wish to joun us live.

And if you yourself would like to speak with me on one of these spaces, which are casual but recorded (and we can optionally post them on my podcast), please [sign up for a future Sunday conversation on any topic](https://cal.com/bryankam/call).
