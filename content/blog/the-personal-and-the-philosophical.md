## Epistolary podcast, plus AI and Pyrrhonism

I‚Äôve got two more podcasts for you!

# The personal

First, I released an experiment I‚Äôve been wanting to try since 2020. This was to release a series of ‚Äúvoicenotes‚Äù as a podcast.

Voice notes are much like voicemails, but within apps like WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram. They‚Äôre asynchronous audio files that can record up to 30 minutes (in WhatsApp at least). But they show up like messages and can be played back at any time.

In the early lockdown, I got to know a lot of people from the internet through voicenotes. They were a great way of getting deep conversations without the hassle of Zoom or worrying about timezones.

In sending and receiving many of these, I concluded that they are a medium more like **writing and receiving letters** than they are like phone calls (even though they use voice) or texts (even though they‚Äôre asynchronous).

So I‚Äôm calling this series of podcasts ‚Äúepistolary‚Äù (which means ‚Äúletter-like‚Äù).

I‚Äôm extremely excited that my friend [Joachim Brackx](https://twitter.com/JoachimBrackx) agreed to send some of these via Telegram with me so that I could release them as a podcast. We each recorded 1 minute, then 2, 4, and 8 minutes to make a 30 minute podcast.

 _You can listen to this first[epistolary podcast](https://pod.fo/e/16ab84), which meandered its way from choice to desire and thence to purpose._

# The philosophical

In [another episode](https://pod.fo/e/16b474), I continue my discussion [Isabela Granic](https://twitter.com/PlayNiceInst). Isabela has been incredibly kind in offering to do a series of interviews with me on the ideas contained in the philosophy book I‚Äôm writing. This series is currently the best place to find out about that thinking.

This episode is Part 3 in a series of interviews on the book I'm working on, _Neither/Nor_. In this episode, [Isabela Granic](https://twitter.com/PlayNiceInst) and I discuss how AI technologies like ChatGPT relate to living textual traditions. We then move into Socrates versus the Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi. We then move into an ancient Greek form of scepticism called ‚ÄúPyrrhonism‚Äù which, like Buddhism, charts a "middle way" between dogmatism and nihilism.

 _Listen[here](https://pod.fo/e/16b474)._

Oh, and if you‚Äôve lost track, I‚Äôve started a thread that describes each podcast:
