In April 2023, I asked listeners to [my podcast](https://podfollow.com/bkam) a question:

How do you balance making a living with living a meaningful life?

I received 31 responses in the form of heartfelt voicenote monologues, which I cut together as six podcasts.

You can listen to the final episode here on Substack, or else [here](https://pod.fo/e/2167b0).

I'm immensely grateful to each and every one of you for your thoughtful, generous reflections.

Yesterday, I wrote some reflections about what has changed for me over the course of this experiment. You can read these reflections for free [over at Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/final-episode-of-97227869?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=postshare_creator&utm_content=join_link), where I post at a higher frequency than here, and where you can also support my work.

I hope you’re finding balance on this question. I look forward to hearing from you.

Finally: I have not forgotten about the [Dichotomies](https://bryankam.substack.com/p/dichotomies-ii) series I began last year…

All best,

Bryan
