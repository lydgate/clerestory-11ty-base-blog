# Slingerland

On **Saturday** , 17 September, I am hosting a [Interintellect SuperSalon](https://interintellect.com/salon/drunk-supersalon-how-we-sipped-danced-and-stumbled-our-way-to-civilization-with-author-edward-slingerland/) on Zoom with author and professor of philosophy [Edward Slingerland](https://twitter.com/slingerland20), about his new book _[Drunk: How We Sipped, Danced, and Stumbled Our Way to Civilization](https://amzn.to/3DfM7In)_ (2021), which is a history of alcohol (and other intoxicants) over the course of human history.

I hosted a converation in London with Slingerland last month; *I loved his book, and I recorded a [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5Y2grkappY) of his book. You can read more about the book [here](https://www.edwardslingerland.com/drunk).

# Green

On **Wednesday** , 14 September, if you’re in London, I am hosting an in-person book club with author Matthew Green, about his new book _[Shadowlands: A Journey through Lost Britain](https://amzn.to/3BzfWm0)_ (2022). I’m reading the book now and can highly recommend it.

 **[Details here](https://mailchi.mp/d1112d9912cd/671qvievow-9278325)** , and you can just turn up.

# Quine

Finally, **tomorrow** , 13 September, I’m hosting a [Twitter space (audio only) at 8pm London time](https://twitter.com/bryankam/status/1569248286963339264), on the first sectionn of a paper by the philosopher WVO Quine. This will be a discussion with [Saliem Chiu](https://twitter.com/saliemchiu) and we will be joined by professor of philosophy [Bryan W. Van Norden](http://www.bryanvannorden.com/).

Quine's 1951 paper "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" ([PDF](http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/QuineWVO-Two-Dogmas-of-Empiricism-1953.pdf)) is "sometimes regarded as the most important in all of twentieth-century philosophy" (according to Peter Godfrey-Smith). Quine bridges the gap between analytic attempts to ground mathematics and philosophy in logic, and newer pragmatist approaches. 

# My work

The Quine conversation will be recorded and will be released on my podcast, [Clerestory](https://anchor.fm/bkam), where I’ve also released a conversation about philosophy which I had in January.

In August I was interviewed by [Eyal Shay on the Deep Dive podcast](https://eyalshay.podbean.com/), which you can listen to [here](https://kite.link/Fiction). This podcast is one of the more comprehensive descriptions of where I am with my work.

I have also started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BryanKam8) and a [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/bryankam8), where I am drafting video lectures. You can also schedule a conversation with me on Twitter spaces [here](https://cal.com/bryankam/call).

Finally, if you're interested in supporting my work, I have started a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bryankam). I am not paywalling content, just using it as a central place to list what I’ve been working on.

I hope you are well. I would love to hear from you; you can respond to this email!

All best,

Bryan
