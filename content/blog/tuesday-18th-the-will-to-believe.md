On Tuesday 18th October 2022 at 8:30pm London time I will be hosting a [discussion](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1mrGmkXbvWqxy) on the question of religious pragmatism. Can we choose what to believe? Are there situations when we should adopt beliefs without evidence?

[This will take place on Twitter Spaces.](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1mrGmkXbvWqxy)

The conversation will be recorded, so you can listen to it even if you can’t attend, and potentially released as a podcast later on.

Hope to have you there!
