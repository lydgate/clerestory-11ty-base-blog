This page gives the latest information for the book I’m writing, called _Neither/Nor_.

###  _Neither/Nor_

 _We live in two worlds: one of language, logic, concepts, and abstractions — and another, of sensations, experience, and intuition. They’re inseparable and enrich one another, but each world has its own native tongue, native practices, and natural inclinations._

I am writing a book called _Neither/Nor_ , which provides a methodology for recognizing and pragmatically applying philosophical frameworks. The methodology helps its practitioners understand, at a meta-level, how to think about philosophical and scientific approaches, when and how to apply them, how to recognize when they are failing, and how to switch strategies skillfully.

In short, it provides a methodology for healthy inquiry and intervention, which avoids the twin pitfalls of too much abstraction and too much experience.

### History

For the past three years, I have delved deeply into Eastern philosophy, especially the doctrine of [dependent origination in early Buddhism](https://clerestory.netlify.app/do/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20230504) — which promises to end suffering for individuals — and the anti-dogmatic Taoism of Zhuangzi.

At the same time, I immersed myself in the ancient Greek philosophies: first Stoicism, then Epicureanism, with brief forays into Platonism and Aristotelianism, and most recently culminating in the practice of [Pyrrho’s ancient scepticism](https://pod.fo/e/16b474).

Finally, I became conversant in the more recent Western philosophical debates (from the 16th century on), especially centering on questions of truth, science, and progress, taking place from the early modern period to the 20th century, including Montaigne, Pascal, Spinoza, Hume, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Peirce, Wittgenstein, and Kuhn.

 _Neither/Nor_ will look at three millennia of thinking across cultures to provide a practical understanding of when to use a map, and when to explore the territory. It is grounded in experience, meditative practices, and experimentation.

### What this means for you

I am developing my ideas in conversation with the public, including you. My goal is to create living philosophy, and — eventually — literature and art.

You can listen to [my podcasts](https://anchor.fm/bkam), or talk to me about the history of philosophy and of science on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bryankam) and [Mastodon](http://writing.exchange/@bryankam).

I would love for you to join me in these conversations, and for you to ask questions and provide feedback. Your interest and experience will be invaluable as I strive to make my work accessible and practically useful to the public.
