## _Neither/Nor_ Live in London

If you’re in London this Sunday 28th May, I will be hosting a discussion of my book on philosophy, _Neither/Nor_ , from 3pm at the Fitzroy Tavern, near Tottenham Court Road. You can read more about the book

## Question and Answers

I’m also experimenting with conversational formats on the [podcast](https://podfollow.com/bkam).

As part of the practice of _Neither/Nor_ , I’ve asked listeners this question:

 _ **How do you balance making a living with living a meaningful life?**_

The idea is to receive reflections as voice note monologues, then stitch them together, as multiple answers to a single question.

  * In the [first episode](https://pod.fo/e/178140), you can hear the first **seven** responses I received to this question, from [Nasos](https://twitter.com/naspap3), [Romeo](https://twitter.com/RomeoStevens76), [Jay](https://mastodon.social/@jaystephens), [Khuyen](https://twitter.com/GKhuyen), [Joachim](https://twitter.com/JoachimBrackx), [Nicole](https://twitter.com/NicoleBosky), and [Nathan](https://disabled.social/@nathanlovestrees).

  * In the [second episode](https://pod.fo/e/17a81c), you can hear the next **four** responses, from [Adam](https://twitter.com/agnbarnett), [Isabela](https://twitter.com/PlayNiceInst), [⁠Gareth](https://www.solve.earth), and [Catherine](https://twitter.com/chwoodiwiss).

  * In the [third episode](https://pod.fo/e/17df79), you can hear another **five** responses, from [Caleb](https://twitter.com/calebmeredth), [Delia](https://deliaburgess.blog/), [Samantha](https://twitter.com/_samand_), [Carolina](https://instampa.co/), and [Jacqueline](https://mstdn.social/@photovotary).




I’ll continue publishing responses as I receive them.

I'd love to hear your response. If you'd like to participate, please submit your audio [here](https://pod.fo/e/178140).

Bryan
