In this episode I give Kuhn's 1973 lecture "Objectivity, Value Judgment, and Theory Choice" (1973). There is a PDF of the lecture [here](http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/3330/kuhn-objectivity.pdf). The book he discusses is _[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://amzn.to/34Cun7C)_. I found the clip of Kuhn speaking on a closely related topic in [this clip](https://amzn.to/34Cun7C) from 1995.
