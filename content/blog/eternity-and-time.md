I spoke to Kit Tempest-Walters about his new book: [⁠](https://brill.com/display/title/63999) _[Plotinus on Eternity and Time](https://brill.com/display/title/63999)_[⁠](https://brill.com/display/title/63999), which includes a translation and commentary of Ennead III.7.

We discuss the challenges of translating, philosophical perspectives on the self, consciousness, and mysticism.

We also talked about some of my perspectives from the book I'm writing, [⁠](https://bryankam.com/neither) _[Neither/Nor](https://bryankam.com/neither)_[⁠](https://bryankam.com/neither), including the differences in the organizing assumptions of Eastern and Western approaches to philosophy.

I’ve also recorded a brief update about how the writing of Neither/Nor is going, [over on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/neither-nor-104384954?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=postshare_creator&utm_content=join_link). Please consider supporting me there to hear the full update.

Thanks,
