In a few weeks I will be hosting an in-person salon in London with [Kate Kirkpatrick](https://www.katekirkpatrick.co.uk/). Kate is the author of _[Becoming Beauvoir](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/becoming-beauvoir-9781350168435/)_ (2019), and she is Fellow in Philosophy and Christian Ethics, University of Oxford (Regent’s).

This is a member’s event for the [Interintellect](https://interintellect.com/); if you would like to become a member, you can [join here](https://interintellect.com/community/).

The details for the event are here: **[Love and Alienation: Kate Kirkpatrick on Simone de Beauvoir](https://interintellect.com/salon/love-femininity-and-alienation-kate-kirkpatrick-on-simone-de-beauvoir/)**.

In preparation, I’m reading parts of Simone de Beauvoir’s _[The Second Sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Sex)_ (1949) for the first time, before I read Kate’s article: [“Simone de Beauvoir’s authentic love is a project of equals.”](https://aeon.co/essays/simone-de-beauvoirs-authentic-love-is-a-project-of-equals)
