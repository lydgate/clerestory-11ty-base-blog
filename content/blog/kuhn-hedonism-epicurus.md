## Kuhn

I have finished the Twitter thread I was writing on Thomas Kuhn’s seminal work in the history and philosophy of science, _[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://amzn.to/3mpEDaq)_.

 **You can read it[here](https://twitter.com/bryankam/status/1303688412923400192).**

Yes, it’s a long thread, but it is much shorter than the book, and I hope it is easier to follow. I also had fun linking it all together. If you don’t feel like reading the whole thing, you could look at Kuhn’s answers to questions like these:

  * [How does a scientific revolution begin?](https://twitter.com/bryankam/status/1322133983107403777)

  * [Why doesn’t philosophy progress like science?](https://twitter.com/bryankam/status/1330842700808151041)

  * [Does science get closer to “truth”?](https://twitter.com/bryankam/status/1331187559674810368)




I’d love to hear any feedback you have on the thread (or by email).

## Hedonism

The asceticism salon we had on 19 November was fascinating; thank you to all those who attended!

[The next salon in the series — on Hedonism — is ](https://bit.ly/ii_hed)**[this Thursday at 7pm GMT](https://bit.ly/ii_hed)**.

We will look at ancient and modern conceptions of hedonism, including the connection between excess and artistic creativity, and the history of florid literary confessions.

## Epicurus

Even if you can’t make the salon, but _especially_ if you can, I’d encourage you to read Catherine Wilson’s Aeon piece on the most consequential hedonist philosophy, Epicureanism: **[“How to be an Epicurean.”](https://aeon.co/essays/forget-plato-aristotle-and-the-stoics-try-being-epicurean)**

Through her work I’ve become interested in this philosophy. [I wrote a short piece looking at what Epicurus meant by hedonism](https://bit.ly/33urtBF) and his unfortunate legacy. I continued that post with some reflections on [Epicurus’ view of deities and death](https://bit.ly/3fUrJi2) (plus a comparison to Epictetus).

## Eudaimonia

The final salon in the trilogy will be on what is needed for the Good Life: _flourishing,_ or its Greek philosophical name _[eudaimonia](https://bit.ly/ii_eud)_[, on Wednesday, 16 December](https://bit.ly/ii_eud). I hope to tie together what we learned from self-abnegation with what we learned from the pursuit of pleasure, and to discuss the attributes of a life well-lived.

As always, I’d love to hear from you!

Bryan
