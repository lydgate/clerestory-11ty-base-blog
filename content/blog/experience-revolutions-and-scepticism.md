Hello!

I’ve released two more podcasts with [Isabela Granic](https://twitter.com/PlayNiceInst) this week. These are part of a series intended to explore the ideas in the book I’m writing, _Neither/Nor_ :

  * [Language and Experience](https://pod.fo/e/16f7ac)

  * [Crises and Revolutions](https://pod.fo/e/171350)




I’m also hosting an online event for my Interintellect fellowship. Save the date, **Saturday,** **15 April at 5pm London time** :

[“You’re Entitled to No Opinion: Ancient Scepticism in the Modern World”](https://interintellect.com/salon/youre-entitled-to-no-opinion-ancient-scepticism-in-the-modern-world/)

Hope to see you there!

Bryan
