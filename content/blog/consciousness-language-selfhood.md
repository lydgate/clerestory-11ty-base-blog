**Summary:** I’m hosting another salon on Zoom on 24th August. [Please come](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/growing-a-mind-is-selfhood-emergent-with-bryan-kam-ii-salon-tickets-116660307119)!

Over the past few months I have been thinking about complexity and the conditions under which it increases, often [rapidly](https://bryankam.substack.com/p/step-changes-in-complexity). Why do atoms form from particles, or multicellular organisms from unicellular ones?

Alongside this interest I’ve been asking more personal questions, some of which have loomed longer and larger in my life: How does a mind emerge from neurons in the brain? How does selfhood arise from consciousness? What is the nature of suffering, and how does it relate to selfhood? And how does language fit into all this?

 _ **These questions are related.**_

I will be writing on exactly how in the coming months on [my blog](https://clerestory.netlify.app/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20200815), where I will connect them with the [series on revolutions](https://clerestory.netlify.app/revolutions?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20200815).

If you’re interested in discussing this topic on Zoom, please join the salon I am hosting through the [Interintellect](https://www.interintellect.com/) on **Monday 24th August 2020 at 8pm BST**. Please note that this is an hour earlier than the previous two salons. You can read more about the event or get tickets **[here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/growing-a-mind-is-selfhood-emergent-with-bryan-kam-ii-salon-tickets-116660307119)**.

If you can’t make the salon, I’d still really love to discuss these ideas with you. Please respond to this email, reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bryankam), or let’s [schedule a call](https://bryankam.com/call).

Look forward to hearing from you,

Bryan
